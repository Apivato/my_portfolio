# How I worked on this project

My Goal was to simulate a professional working environment using:

- App was built following a figma design
- Tasks were created and followed on project board
- feature branches and Pull requets were used

# How to navigate this project

This project is a react based web app with tailwind handling the stylings
the source code can be found in Src while the assets used are in the assets directory.

# Why I built the project this way

- I built the My portfolio page like this because i wanted to have an interactice space to display my experience, skills and intrests to the world.
- I also wanted to try and design something that would allow for people to interact with and get to know me personally while having an effcient method of implementation
- I plan on becoming a full stack developper and therefore this project is a good stepping stone to learning and practicing my craft.

# If I had more time I would change this

- I would like to add more creative things to look at, either in the background or in the design of the layout
- I would change the color pallete to be more pleasing to the eyes and calming

# Available Scripts
